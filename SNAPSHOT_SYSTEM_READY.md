# ✅ Snapshot System Ready

**Status**: OPERATIONAL ✅

## New Commands Available

### `/write_snap` - Save Current State
**Purpose**: Create token-efficient recovery snapshot before `/clear`

**What it does**:
1. Analyzes current state (git, CI, PRs, issues)
2. Identifies open loops, broken windows, quick wins
3. Recommends next actions with specific commands
4. Writes to `.snapshots/snap-{timestamp}.md`
5. Updates `snap-latest.md` symlink

**When to use**:
- ✅ Before `/clear` (save progress)
- ✅ After major milestone (preserve context)
- ✅ End of session (document state)
- ✅ Before switching tasks (capture context)

**Output**: `.snapshots/snap-2025-10-03-1745.md` (~2k tokens)

---

### `/prime_snap` - Recover Session
**Purpose**: Quickly restore full context after `/clear`

**What it does**:
1. Loads latest snapshot (`snap-latest.md`)
2. Loads core files (constitution, CLAUDE.md, agency.py, ADRs)
3. Loads snapshot-specific files (from "Key Files" section)
4. Checks current status (git, PRs, CI)
5. Presents recovery summary with next action
6. Optionally executes first recommended command

**When to use**:
- ✅ After `/clear` (restore context)
- ✅ Start of new session (quick recovery)
- ✅ Switching between epics (reload context)

**Load time**: <60 seconds, ~5k tokens total

---

## How It Works

### 1. End of Session
```bash
/write_snap
```

**Output**:
```
✅ Snapshot saved: .snapshots/snap-2025-10-03-1745.md

Summary:
- Current State: 99.6% CI green (3245 passing, 11 failing)
- Open Loops: 11 test failures, Trinity Trust Imperative ready
- Recommendation: Start Trinity epic
- First Action: Read TRINITY_ADE_BACKLOG.md
```

### 2. Start of Next Session
```bash
/clear        # Clear conversation history
/prime_snap   # Restore from snapshot
```

**Output**:
```
📸 Session Recovered from Snapshot

Last Session Summary:
- Restored main from 0% → 99.6% CI green
- Fixed deps (PR #13) + 24 test bugs (PR #15)
- 11 impl bugs remain (0.4%, not blocking)

Open Loops:
1. Trinity Trust Imperative epic (ready to start)
2. 11 test failures (low priority)
3. Doc consolidation (optional)

Recommended Next Action:
Read /Users/am/Code/Agency/TRINITY_ADE_BACKLOG.md

Quick Context:
- Main Branch: 99.6% green ✅
- Open PRs: 0
- CI Status: Passing (13 failures, impl bugs)
- Priority: Trinity Trust Imperative

Loaded Files:
- Core: constitution.md, CLAUDE.md, agency.py, ADR-INDEX.md
- Snapshot: snap-2025-10-03-1745.md
- Status: git status, PR list, CI status

Ready to continue. First action: Read TRINITY_ADE_BACKLOG.md

git status
# ... do work ...
# ... commit changes ...

# End of session (context getting full)
/write_snap
# ✅ Snapshot saved

# Later or next day
/clear             # Clear history, free tokens

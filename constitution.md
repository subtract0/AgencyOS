# Agency Constitution

> *The non-negotiable rulebook for all agents and engineering decisions*

**Version**: 1.0
**Established**: 2025-09-22
**Authority**: Mandated by @am
**Compliance**: Mandatory for all agents

---

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles governing the Agency multi-agent system. These rules are **non-negotiable** and **machine-enforceable**. All agents MUST read, understand, and adhere to these principles before generating any plans, specifications, or implementations.

**Core Philosophy**: *Professional excellence through automated discipline and continuous learning.*

## Article I: Complete Context Before Action (ADR-001)

### Section 1.1: Foundational Principle
**No action shall be taken without complete contextual understanding.**

### Section 1.2: Mandatory Practices

#### Timeout Handling
- At EVERY timeout: halt and analyze
- Retry with extended timeouts (2x, 3x, up to 10x)
- NEVER proceed with incomplete data
- NEVER declare "I have seen enough" with partial results

#### Test Execution
- ALL tests MUST run to completion
- Upon failures or skips: IMMEDIATELY halt
- Fix failing tests BEFORE new features
- No mission is complete while tests fail

#### Context Verification
- Explicitly verify: "Do I have all information?"
- When uncertain: re-execute
- Better 5 minutes of waiting than 5 hours in wrong direction

#### No Broken Windows
- Applies to ALL generated code
- Applies to "temporary" solutions
- Applies under ALL circumstances
- Zero tolerance for compromised quality

### Section 1.3: Implementation Requirements
```python
# Required pattern for all agents
def ensure_complete_context(operation_func, max_retries=3):
    timeout = 120000  # Start with 2 minutes

    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        result = operation_func(timeout=timeout)

        if result.timed_out:
            timeout *= 2  # Double timeout for retry
            continue

        if result.incomplete:
            continue  # Retry with same timeout

        if result.has_failures():
            raise Exception("STOP: Fix failures before proceeding")

        return result

    raise Exception("Unable to obtain complete context")
```

## Article II: 100% Verification and Stability (ADR-002)

### Section 2.1: Foundational Principle
**A task is complete ONLY when 100% verified and stable.**

### Section 2.2: Non-Negotiable Standards

#### Test Success Rate
- Main branch MUST maintain 100% test success
- No merge without completely green CI pipeline
- Failing tests block ALL other activities
- **100% is not negotiable - no exceptions**

#### Quality Requirements
- Tests MUST verify REAL functionality, not simulated behavior
- No test deactivation or skip markers (except platform-specific)
- No assertion removal to force test passage
- When tests fail: code is wrong, not test

#### No Simulation in Production (Amendment 2025-10-02)
- Mocked functions SHALL NOT be merged to main branch
- Simulated work (print statements, hardcoded responses) is NOT production-ready
- Demonstration code MUST remain in feature branches or docs/examples/
- Only fully-implemented, tested functionality may merge to main
- "Green tests" means tests validate REAL behavior, not mock behavior

#### "Delete the Fire First" Priority
- BEFORE new features: all tests green
- BEFORE refactoring: all tests green
- BEFORE optimization: all tests green
- Broken windows have ALWAYS highest priority

#### Definition of Done
1. Code written ✓
2. Tests written ✓
3. All tests pass ✓
4. Code review ✓
5. CI pipeline green ✓
6. = COMPLETE (not before)

### Section 2.3: Enforcement Mechanisms
```bash
# Required pre-commit pattern
if [ $TEST_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ BLOCKED by Constitution Article II"
    echo "100% test success required - no exceptions"
    exit 1
fi
```

---

## Article III: Automated Merge Enforcement (ADR-003)

### Section 3.1: Foundational Principle
**Quality standards SHALL be technically enforced, not manually governed.**

### Section 3.2: Enforcement Architecture

#### Zero-Tolerance Policy
- No manual override capabilities
- No "emergency bypass" mechanisms
- 100% test success at ALL enforcement layers
- Automatic rejection of quality violations

#### Multi-Layer Enforcement
1. **Pre-commit Hook**: Local enforcement preventing bad commits
2. **Agent Validation**: Automated agent-level verification
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Remote verification and enforcement
4. **Branch Protection**: Repository-level safeguards

#### No Bypass Authority
- No human can override enforcement
- No emergency exceptions permitted
- Quality gates are absolute barriers
- System failure requires infrastructure repair, not bypass

### Section 3.3: Agent Requirements
```python
# All agents must implement enforcement checking
def validate_constitutional_compliance(operation):
    if not passes_article_i_verification(operation):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article I: Incomplete context")
    if not passes_article_ii_verification(operation):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article II: Quality standards not met")
    if not passes_article_iii_verification(operation):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article III: Enforcement bypassed")
    return True
```

## Article IV: Continuous Learning and Improvement (ADR-004)

### Section 4.1: Foundational Principle
**The Agency SHALL continuously improve through experiential learning.**

### Section 4.2: Learning Requirements

#### Automatic Learning Triggers
- After successful session completion
- After error resolution sequences
- After effective tool usage patterns
- When performance milestones achieved

#### Learning Quality Standards
- Minimum confidence threshold: 0.6
- Minimum evidence count: 3 occurrences
- Pattern validation required before storage
- Regular cleanup of outdated learnings

#### Collective Intelligence
- All agents benefit from shared learnings
- Cross-session pattern recognition required
- Knowledge accumulates in VectorStore
- Learning-informed decision making mandatory

### Section 4.3: Self-Improvement Mandate
```python
# Required learning integration pattern
class ConstitutionalAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_context):
        self.learning_store = agent_context.vector_store
        self.constitutional_compliance = True

    def before_action(self, context):
        # Check constitutional compliance
        self.validate_constitutional_adherence()
        # Apply relevant learnings
        self.apply_historical_learnings(context)

    def after_action(self, result):
        # Extract learnings from experience
        self.extract_and_store_learnings(result)
```

---

## Article V: Spec-Driven Development (This Constitution)

### Section 5.1: Foundational Principle
**All development SHALL follow formal specification and planning processes.**

### Section 5.2: Mandatory Workflows

#### Specification Requirement
- New features MUST begin with formal spec.md
- Spec follows template: Goals, Non-Goals, Personas, Acceptance Criteria
- No implementation without approved specification
- Specifications are living documents - updated as needed

#### Technical Planning Requirement
- Approved specs MUST generate formal plan.md
- Plans detail: Architecture, Agent assignments, Tool usage, Contracts
- Implementation blocked until plan approval
- Plans reference constitutional requirements

#### Task Granularity Requirement
- Plans MUST decompose into TodoWrite task lists
- Each task MUST reference spec and plan sections
- Tasks MUST be verifiable against acceptance criteria
- Progress tracking required throughout implementation

### Section 5.3: Agent Compliance Requirements
```python
# Required pattern for all planning agents
def constitutional_planning_process(feature_request):
    # 1. Read constitution for compliance requirements
    constitution = read_constitution()

    # 2. Generate specification following Article V requirements
    spec = generate_specification(feature_request, constitution)

    # 3. Create implementation plan with constitutional validation
    plan = create_implementation_plan(spec, constitution)

    # 4. Break down into constitutional-compliant tasks
    tasks = create_granular_tasks(plan, constitution)

    return spec, plan, tasks
```

---

## Enforcement and Compliance

### Constitutional Validation
Every agent MUST implement constitutional compliance checking:

```python
def validate_constitutional_compliance(agent_action):
    """Validate action against constitutional requirements."""

    # Article I: Complete Context
    if not has_complete_context(agent_action):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article I violated: Incomplete context")

    # Article II: 100% Verification
    if not meets_quality_standards(agent_action):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article II violated: Quality standards not met")

    # Article III: Automated Enforcement
    if not passes_automated_checks(agent_action):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article III violated: Enforcement bypassed")

    # Article IV: Learning Integration
    if not incorporates_learnings(agent_action):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article IV violated: Learning not applied")

    # Article V: Spec-Driven Process
    if not follows_spec_driven_process(agent_action):
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article V violated: Spec-driven process not followed")

    return True
```

### Agent Instructions Template
ALL agent instructions MUST include:

```markdown
## Constitutional Compliance

Before any action, you MUST:
1. Read and understand /constitution.md
2. Validate your planned action against all five articles
3. Ensure your approach follows spec-driven development (Article V)
4. Apply relevant learnings from VectorStore (Article IV)
5. Maintain 100% quality standards (Article II)
6. Gather complete context (Article I)
7. Work within automated enforcement systems (Article III)

NEVER proceed with any action that violates constitutional principles.
Constitutional violations are BLOCKERS that must be resolved.
```

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Constitutional Compliance Rate**: Must maintain 100%
- **Violation Detection Time**: Target <1 minute
- **Learning Application Rate**: >80% of applicable patterns used
- **Spec-Driven Compliance**: 100% of new features follow Article V

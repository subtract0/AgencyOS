# 🚀 Trinity Protocol: Pre-Flight Checklist

**Quick Reference**: Use this checklist before launching Trinity Protocol implementation.

---

## ✅ FOUNDATION AUDIT RESULTS

### Automated Checks (COMPLETED ✅)

- ✅ **1,636 tests** collected successfully
- ✅ **Constitutional compliance** verified (all 5 articles)
- ✅ **OpenAI API** configured
- ✅ **Firebase/Firestore** configured
- ✅ **CI/CD workflows** present (5 workflows)
- ✅ **QualityEnforcerAgent** operational
- ✅ **Git repository** clean and on main branch
- ✅ **No critical broken windows** detected

**Automated Audit Report**: See `docs/TRINITY_FOUNDATION_AUDIT.md`

---

## ⏳ MANUAL SMOKE TESTS (REQUIRED)

### Test 1: End-to-End Agent Execution (15 min)

```bash
# Simple task to verify full agent loop
poetry run python -m cli.main execute \
  "Add a comment to README.md explaining AgencyOS in one sentence"
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [ ] Task completes without hanging
- [ ] Changes are committed to git
- [ ] No unexpected errors
- [ ] Repository left in clean state

**If FAILS**: Document issue, fix before Trinity

---

### Test 2: Firestore Persistence (5 min)

```bash
# Test 1: Write a pattern
poetry run python -c "
from core.persistent_learning import store_pattern
pattern_id = store_pattern('test_trinity_launch', {
    'confidence': 0.9, 
    'type': 'foundation_test',
    'timestamp': '2025-09-30'
})
print(f'✅ Pattern stored with ID: {pattern_id}')
print('Now kill this process and run the test again...')
"

# IMPORTANT: Kill the process (Ctrl+C), then run again
# The pattern should still exist in Firestore

# Test 2: Verify persistence
poetry run python -c "
from core.persistent_learning import get_patterns
patterns = get_patterns()
test_pattern = [p for p in patterns if 'test_trinity_launch' in str(p)]
if test_pattern:
    print(f'✅ PASS: Pattern persisted across restart')
    print(f'   Found: {test_pattern}')
else:
    print('❌ FAIL: Pattern not found after restart')
"
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [ ] Pattern writes successfully
- [ ] Pattern survives process restart
- [ ] Pattern is retrievable after restart

**If FAILS**: Fix Firestore integration before Trinity

## 📋 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

### Critical (MUST Complete)

- [ ] **Run Test 1**: E2E Agent Execution → PASS
- [ ] **Run Test 2**: Firestore Persistence → PASS
- [ ] **Commit Trinity Docs**:
  ```bash
  git add docs/trinity_protocol_implementation.md
  git add docs/reference/Trinity.pdf
  git add docs/TRINITY_FOUNDATION_AUDIT.md
  git add docs/TRINITY_PREFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md
  git commit -m "docs: Add Trinity Protocol foundation and audit"
  git push origin main
  ```
- [ ] **Review Audit Report**: Read `docs/TRINITY_FOUNDATION_AUDIT.md`

---

### Recommended (SHOULD Complete)

- [ ] **Create project directories**:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p specs plans trinity_protocol
  ```
- [ ] **Document any smoke test failures** (if any occurred)
- [ ] **Set baseline performance metrics**:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest tests/test_pattern_intelligence_benchmarks.py --benchmark-only
  ```

---

## 🚦 GO/NO-GO DECISION

### ✅ GREEN = PROCEED TO TRINITY

**ALL MUST BE TRUE**:
- ✅ Test 1 (E2E) passed
- ✅ Test 2 (Firestore) passed
- ✅ Audit report reviewed
- ✅ Trinity docs committed

**If all green → START WEEK 1 IMMEDIATELY** 🚀

---

### 🔴 RED = PAUSE & FIX FOUNDATION

**ANY OF THESE = STOP**:
- ❌ Test 1 hangs or crashes
- ❌ Test 2 loses data on restart
- ❌ Critical errors in smoke tests
- ❌ Firestore not accessible

**If red → Fix issues before Trinity, iterate on foundation**

---

## 📅 POST-LAUNCH TRACKING

### Week 1 Checkpoint (End of Foundation Build)

- [ ] Persistent store (SQLite + FAISS) implemented
- [ ] Message bus (async queue) implemented
- [ ] Tests for Trinity foundation passing
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: All existing AgencyOS tests still passing

**If Week 1 fails → Rollback, fix issues, try again**

---

### Week 4 Checkpoint (Before PLAN/EXECUTE)

- [ ] AUDITLEARN detects real patterns from usage
- [ ] Patterns persist across restarts
- [ ] Dashboard shows live pattern detection
- [ ] At least 3 high-confidence patterns stored
- [ ] Local model inference < 5s per scan cycle

**If Week 4 fails → Iterate on foundation, don't proceed to orchestration**

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Foundation is Ready When:

1. ✅ Both smoke tests pass consistently (3/3 runs)
2. ✅ No mysterious failures or hangs
3. ✅ Firestore persistence is reliable
4. ✅ Git operations are safe
5. ✅ All existing tests still passing

### Foundation is NOT Ready When:

1. ❌ Smoke tests fail or hang
2. ❌ Data loss occurs
3. ❌ Git repo corrupted
4. ❌ Existing tests broken
5. ❌ Critical services unavailable

---

## 🛠️ Emergency Contacts & Resources

### If Tests Fail:

1. **Check logs**: `logs/events/` for telemetry
2. **Check Firestore**: Firebase console
3. **Check Git**: `git status`, `git log`
4. **Run diagnostics**: `poetry run python scripts/constitutional_check.py`
5. **Full test suite**: `poetry run pytest tests/ -v`

### Key Files:

- Audit Report: `docs/TRINITY_FOUNDATION_AUDIT.md`
- Implementation Plan: `docs/trinity_protocol_implementation.md`
- Constitutional Check: `scripts/constitutional_check.py`
- Test Runner: `run_tests.py`

---

## 📞 FINAL GO/NO-GO

**Date**: _______________  
**Reviewer**: _______________

### Checklist Signature:

- [ ] Manual smoke tests completed
- [ ] Results documented
- [ ] Decision made: **GO** / **NO-GO** (circle one)
- [ ] If GO: Week 1 kickoff scheduled
- [ ] If NO-GO: Blockers documented, fix plan created

---

**Signature**: _______________  
**Ready for Trinity**: **YES** / **NO**

## 🚀 LAUNCH COMMAND

**When all checks pass, run:**

```bash
# Create Trinity foundation directory
mkdir -p trinity_protocol/{tests,dashboard,config}

# Create initial __init__.py
touch trinity_protocol/__init__.py

# Copy implementation plan to workspace
cp docs/trinity_protocol_implementation.md trinity_protocol/README.md

# Open implementation guide
code trinity_protocol/README.md

# Begin Week 1: Persistent Store + Message Bus
echo "🚀 Trinity Protocol: Week 1 begins NOW!"
```

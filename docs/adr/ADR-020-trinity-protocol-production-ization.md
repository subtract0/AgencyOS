## Context

### Current State Analysis

**Trinity Protocol Overview:**
- **Total Lines**: 18,914 lines (37% of entire 51,000-line codebase!)
- **Total Files**: 47 Python files + 5 models
- **Distribution**: Production code mixed with experimental prototypes and demo files
- **Problem**: Unclear separation between production-ready vs. experimental features

**File Breakdown by Category:**

1. **Production-Ready Core** (~10 files, estimated 5,000 lines):
   - `executor_agent.py` (774 lines) - Project execution coordinator
   - `architect_agent.py` (729 lines) - Project architecture planner
   - `witness_agent.py` (pattern detection only)
   - `cost_tracker.py` (473 lines) - Budget tracking system
   - `cost_dashboard.py` (626 lines) - Cost visualization
   - `foundation_verifier.py` (382 lines) - CI/tests validation
   - `models/project.py` (604 lines) - Project data models
   - `models/preferences.py` (485 lines) - User preferences
   - `models/hitl.py` - Human-in-the-loop models
   - `models/patterns.py` - Pattern detection models

2. **Experimental/Prototype** (~6 files, estimated 3,500 lines):
   - `audio_capture.py` - Microphone capture (not production-critical)
   - `ambient_listener_service.py` (374 lines) - Always-on listening (privacy concerns)
   - `whisper_transcriber.py` - Transcription service (requires whisper.cpp)
   - `witness_ambient_mode.py` (540 lines) - Ambient witness prototype
   - `transcription_service.py` - Audio transcription
   - `response_handler.py` - Ambient response handling

3. **Demo/Test Files** (~10 files, estimated 4,000 lines):
   - `demo_integration.py`
   - `demo_complete_trinity.py`
   - `demo_hitl.py`
   - `demo_architect.py`
   - `demo_preference_learning.py`
   - `test_dashboard_demo.py`
   - `run_8h_ui_test.py`
   - `run_24h_test.py` (562 lines)
   - `verify_cost_tracking.py`
   - `generate_24h_report.py` (587 lines)

4. **Reusable Components** (should be in shared/, estimated 2,500 lines):
   - Cost tracking system (used by multiple agents)
   - HITL protocol (generic pattern, not Trinity-specific)
   - Preference learning engine (generic user adaptation)
   - Pattern detection (generic behavioral analysis)

**Key Issues:**

1. **Unclear Boundaries**: No clear separation between production-ready and experimental code
2. **High Maintenance Burden**: 37% of codebase requires understanding Trinity internals
3. **Code Duplication**: Demo files duplicate setup code, fixtures, and utilities
4. **Missing Standards**: Experimental code lacks clear upgrade path to production
5. **Reusability Gap**: Generic components buried in Trinity-specific directory

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Cognitive Load**: Developers must navigate 47 files to understand Trinity
- **Onboarding Friction**: New contributors unclear what's production vs. prototype
- **Testing Complexity**: Mixed testing standards (production vs. experimental)
- **Maintenance Cost**: 37% of codebase updates require Trinity context

## Decision

**Reorganize Trinity Protocol into clear production vs. experimental separation** with the following structure:

```

```

**Code Reduction Metrics:**
- **Before**: 18,914 lines (47 files)
- **After**: 11,500 lines (core: 5,000 + experimental: 3,500 + demos: 1,000 + shared: 2,000)
- **Reduction**: 7,414 lines (39% reduction)
- **Clarity**: Clear production/experimental/demo boundaries

---

## Rationale

### 1. Clear Production/Experimental Boundaries

**Problem**: Currently, production-critical code (executor, architect) mixed with experimental prototypes (ambient listener, audio capture).

**Solution**:
- **`trinity_protocol/core/`**: Production-ready modules with 100% test coverage, strict typing, constitutional compliance
- **`trinity_protocol/experimental/`**: Rapid iteration allowed, documented as "EXPERIMENTAL", less stringent quality gates

**Benefits**:
- Developers know exactly what's production-stable vs. prototype
- Different quality standards for different purposes (appropriate for each)
- Clear upgrade path: experimental → production checklist

### 2. Reusable Component Extraction

**Problem**: Generic components (cost tracking, HITL, preferences, patterns) buried in Trinity-specific directory, preventing reuse by other agents.

**Solution**: Extract to `shared/` with clean, generic APIs:
- `shared/cost_tracker.py`: Generic budget tracking (any agent can use)
- `shared/hitl_protocol.py`: Generic human-in-the-loop pattern (reusable)
- `shared/preference_learning.py`: Generic user adaptation (configurable)
- `shared/pattern_detector.py`: Generic behavioral analysis (pluggable)

**Benefits**:
- **Reusability**: All agents benefit from cost tracking, HITL, preferences
- **Maintainability**: Single implementation, shared across agents
- **Testing**: Generic components tested independently
- **Clarity**: Trinity uses shared components (composition over monolith)

### 3. Demo Consolidation

**Problem**: 10 separate demo files with ~60% code duplication (setup, fixtures, teardown).

**Solution**: Consolidate to 3 focused demos:
- `demos/demo_complete.py`: Main Trinity capabilities (executor + architect + witness)
- `demos/demo_hitl.py`: Human-in-the-loop workflow demonstration
- `demos/demo_preferences.py`: Preference learning showcase

**Benefits**:
- **Reduction**: 4,000 lines → 1,000 lines (75% reduction in demo code)
- **Clarity**: Each demo has clear focus and purpose
- **Maintenance**: Shared setup code in demo utilities
- **Quality**: Demos become reliable documentation

### 4. Production Module Criteria

**Production-Ready Requirements** (strict):
- ✅ 100% test coverage (all paths tested)
- ✅ Strict Pydantic typing (no `Dict[Any, Any]`)
- ✅ Constitutional compliance (all 5 articles)
- ✅ Result<T,E> pattern for errors (no exceptions for control flow)
- ✅ Functions <50 lines (focused, single-purpose)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (docstrings, examples)
- ✅ Performance tested (no regressions)

**Experimental Module Criteria** (relaxed for iteration):
- ℹ️ Tests encouraged but not required (rapid prototyping)
- ℹ️ Typing encouraged but not enforced (iteration speed)
- ℹ️ Marked clearly as "EXPERIMENTAL" in docstrings
- ℹ️ Documented upgrade checklist provided (path to production)
- ℹ️ Privacy/security concerns documented (e.g., ambient listener)

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Clarity**: Developers immediately know production vs. experimental status
   - **Metric**: 100% file classification (no ambiguity)
   - **Benefit**: Faster onboarding, reduced confusion

2. **Code Reduction**: 39% reduction in Trinity Protocol size (18,914 → 11,500 lines)
   - **Metric**: 7,414 lines removed through consolidation and extraction
   - **Benefit**: 37% → 23% of total codebase (reduced cognitive load)

3. **Reusability**: 4 shared components benefit all agents
   - **Components**: cost_tracker, hitl_protocol, preference_learning, pattern_detector
   - **Benefit**: Other agents gain cost tracking, HITL, preferences without reimplementation

4. **Quality Separation**: Appropriate standards for each category
   - **Production**: Strict quality gates (100% tests, full typing, constitutional compliance)
   - **Experimental**: Rapid iteration (documented risks, upgrade path)
   - **Benefit**: Quality where it matters, speed where needed

5. **Upgrade Path**: Clear checklist for experimental → production
   - **Checklist**: 6-step validation (tests, typing, compliance, docs, review, migration)
   - **Benefit**: Experimental features can graduate to production systematically

### Negative Consequences

1. **Migration Effort**: Update imports across codebase
   - **Scope**: Search/replace `from trinity_protocol import X` → `from trinity_protocol.core import X`
   - **Mitigation**: Gradual migration with symlinks for backward compatibility during transition

2. **Testing Updates**: Tests must be reorganized for new structure
   - **Scope**: Update test imports, add core/experimental/demo test categorization
   - **Mitigation**: Automated test discovery, pytest fixtures updated once

3. **Documentation Overhead**: README and upgrade checklist needed
   - **Scope**: Trinity README (production vs. experimental guide), upgrade checklist template
   - **Mitigation**: One-time documentation creation, reusable for future modules

4. **Dual Standards**: Maintaining production and experimental criteria
   - **Scope**: Different quality gates for core/ vs. experimental/
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, automated checks (pytest markers, ruff rules)

### Risks

1. **Breaking Changes During Reorganization**
   - **Risk**: Import changes break existing code
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High (if uncaught)
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Incremental migration (one category at a time)
     - Symlinks for backward compatibility during transition
     - Full test suite validation after each step
     - Rollback plan per migration phase

2. **Feature Loss During Consolidation**
   - **Risk**: Experimental features accidentally removed
   - **Probability**: Low
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Pre-migration feature inventory (all 47 files catalogued)
     - Post-migration validation (all features accounted for)
     - Git history preservation (no deletions, only moves)

3. **Unclear Boundaries Over Time**
   - **Risk**: New code added without clear categorization
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium (gradual degradation)
   - **Mitigation**:
     - README with decision criteria (when to use core/ vs. experimental/)
     - Code review checklist (verify correct directory)
     - Automated linting (warn if experimental code in core/)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Leave Trinity As-Is

**Description**: Maintain current 47-file structure with mixed production/experimental code.

**Pros**:
- ✅ No migration effort required
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Familiar structure for current developers

**Cons**:
- ❌ Continued confusion about production vs. experimental status
- ❌ 37% of codebase remains difficult to navigate
- ❌ Reusable components remain inaccessible to other agents
- ❌ Maintenance burden continues to grow

**Why Rejected**: Status quo is not acceptable. Confusion and maintenance burden justify reorganization effort.

---

### Alternative 2: Delete Experimental Code

**Description**: Remove all experimental/prototype code (audio, ambient listener, etc.), keep only production core.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Maximum code reduction (~60% reduction to 7,500 lines)
- ✅ Clear production-only focus
- ✅ Reduced maintenance burden

**Cons**:
- ❌ Loss of valuable prototypes and research work
- ❌ No path for future experimental features
- ❌ Audio/ambient capabilities permanently removed
- ❌ Innovation constrained (no experimental playground)

**Why Rejected**: Experimental code has value. Need balance between production stability and innovation capacity.

---

### Alternative 3: Separate Repositories

**Description**: Split Trinity into separate repositories: `trinity-core`, `trinity-experimental`, `trinity-demos`.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Complete separation (no mixing possible)
- ✅ Independent versioning and release cycles
- ✅ Clear ownership boundaries

**Cons**:
- ❌ Coordination overhead (syncing changes across repos)
- ❌ Dependency management complexity (core version compatibility with experimental)
- ❌ Code duplication risk (shared utilities duplicated across repos)
- ❌ Developer friction (switching between repos for related work)

**Why Rejected**: Overkill for current scale. Monorepo with clear directories sufficient.

---

### Alternative 4: Feature Flags for Experimental Code

**Description**: Keep single directory structure, use feature flags to enable/disable experimental features.

**Pros**:
- ✅ No reorganization effort
- ✅ Runtime control of experimental features
- ✅ A/B testing capabilities

**Cons**:
- ❌ Doesn't solve code organization problem (47 files still mixed)
- ❌ Feature flag complexity (configuration management overhead)
- ❌ Doesn't address reusability (components still buried in Trinity)
- ❌ Testing complexity (combinatorial explosion of flag states)

**Why Rejected**: Doesn't address root cause (unclear boundaries and poor organization).

---

### Phase 3: Reorganize Core, Experimental, Demos (Week 3-4)

**Week 3: Core & Experimental**

**Tasks**:
1. Create directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p trinity_protocol/{core,experimental,demos}
   mkdir -p trinity_protocol/core/models
   ```

2. Migrate production modules to `core/`:
   - Optimize `executor_agent.py` → `core/executor.py` (reduce size, improve clarity)
   - Optimize `architect_agent.py` → `core/architect.py` (reduce size, improve clarity)
   - Optimize `witness_agent.py` → `core/witness.py` (patterns only, remove ambient)
   - Move `orchestrator.py` → `core/orchestrator.py`
   - Move models to `core/models/`

3. Migrate experimental modules to `experimental/`:
   - Move `audio_capture.py` → `experimental/audio_capture.py`
   - Move `ambient_listener_service.py` → `experimental/ambient_listener.py`
   - Move `whisper_transcriber.py` → `experimental/whisper_transcriber.py`
   - Move `witness_ambient_mode.py` → `experimental/witness_ambient.py`

4. Update imports across codebase:
   - Search: `from trinity_protocol import X`
   - Replace: `from trinity_protocol.core import X` or `from trinity_protocol.experimental import X`

**Week 4: Demos & Documentation**

**Tasks**:
1. Consolidate demos:
   - Merge `demo_integration.py`, `demo_complete_trinity.py`, `test_dashboard_demo.py` → `demos/demo_complete.py`
   - Keep `demo_hitl.py` → `demos/demo_hitl.py`
   - Keep `demo_preference_learning.py` → `demos/demo_preferences.py`
   - Remove redundant demo files (verify no unique functionality lost)

2. Create Trinity README:
   ```markdown
   # Trinity Protocol

   ## Production Modules (trinity_protocol/core/)
   - executor.py: Production execution coordinator
   - architect.py: Production architecture planner
   - witness.py: Production pattern witness
   - orchestrator.py: Trinity orchestration

   ## Experimental Modules (trinity_protocol/experimental/)
   - audio_capture.py: EXPERIMENTAL - Microphone capture
   - ambient_listener.py: EXPERIMENTAL - Always-on listening (privacy concerns)
   - whisper_transcriber.py: EXPERIMENTAL - Transcription (requires whisper.cpp)
   - witness_ambient.py: EXPERIMENTAL - Ambient witness prototype

   ## Upgrade Path: Experimental → Production
   [Checklist provided in separate section]
   ```

3. Update documentation:
   - Update main README references to Trinity
   - Update constitution.md if Trinity-specific references exist
   - Update ADR-016 (Ambient Listener) with new paths

**Validation**:
- [ ] All imports updated successfully (no broken references)
- [ ] Full test suite passes (1,568+ tests, 100% pass rate)
- [ ] Trinity README complete with clear categorization
- [ ] Code reduction achieved: 18,914 → 11,500 lines (39%)

---

### Migration Checklist

**Before Migration**:
- [ ] Create feature inventory (all 47 files catalogued)
- [ ] Run full test suite (baseline: all tests pass)
- [ ] Git branch created: `consolidation/trinity-production-ization`
- [ ] Backup current structure (tag: `pre-trinity-reorg`)

**During Migration**:
- [ ] Phase 1: Audit complete (categorization matrix created)
- [ ] Phase 2: Reusable components extracted (4 shared modules in `shared/`)
- [ ] Phase 3: Core/experimental reorganized (directories created, files moved)
- [ ] Phase 4: Demos consolidated (3 demos in `demos/`)
- [ ] Phase 5: Imports updated (search/replace completed)

**After Migration**:
- [ ] Full test suite passes (100% pass rate maintained)
- [ ] Feature inventory validated (zero features lost)
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, ADRs)
- [ ] Code review by ChiefArchitectAgent
- [ ] Constitutional compliance verified (all 5 articles)
- [ ] Merge to main branch

---

### Rollback Plan

**Triggers for Rollback**:
1. Test suite failure (any test fails during migration)
2. Feature loss detected (inventory mismatch)
3. Performance regression (>10% slowdown)
4. Blocking bugs introduced

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. Checkout pre-migration tag: `git checkout pre-trinity-reorg`
2. Analyze failure root cause (logs, telemetry, test output)
3. Document lessons learned (what went wrong)
4. Refine migration approach (address root cause)
5. Retry migration with fixes

**Incremental Migration Strategy** (minimize rollback risk):
- Migrate one category at a time (core, then experimental, then demos)
- Validate tests after each category migration
- Use symlinks for backward compatibility during transition
- Keep old paths functional for 30-day deprecation period

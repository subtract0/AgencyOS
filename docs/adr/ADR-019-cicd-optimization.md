# ADR-019: CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

## Status
**Proposed**

## Date
2025-10-04

## Context

Our current CI/CD pipeline takes 8-10 minutes to provide feedback on pull requests, which slows development velocity and increases costs. With 50 builds per day (10 PRs × 5 commits each), this translates to:

- **400 minutes of CI time daily** (800 minutes with redundant workflows)
- **$138.75/month in GitHub Actions costs**
- **30 hours/month of developer time wasted waiting** (5 developers × 6 hours each)
- **8-minute context switches** that break developer flow

### Current Pipeline Issues

1. **Sequential Test Execution**: All 1,725 tests run sequentially (400s)
2. **No Caching**: Dependencies reinstalled every build (90s wasted)
3. **No Fail-Fast**: Lint errors discovered after 8 minutes
4. **No Smart Testing**: Full suite runs even for 1-line changes
5. **Redundant Setup**: Multiple jobs reinstall same dependencies

### Business Impact

**Developer Productivity**:
- 3 builds waited on per day per developer
- 6 minutes per wait (including context switching)
- 18 minutes/day wasted = 6 hours/month per developer
- **$1,500/month cost** (5 developers × 6 hours × $50/hour)

**CI/CD Costs**:
- Current: $138.75/month
- Projected (with growth): $200+/month within 6 months

**Quality Impact**:
- Slower feedback → more bugs reaching production
- Developer frustration → lower code quality
- Long CI times → skipping tests locally

### Constitutional Considerations

Any optimization MUST maintain:

**Article I: Complete Context Before Action**
- All tests run to completion (no partial results)
- Retry on timeout (constitutional requirement)

**Article II: 100% Verification and Stability**
- Main branch: 100% test success ALWAYS
- No merge without green CI pipeline
- Zero tolerance for broken windows

**Article III: Automated Merge Enforcement**
- Quality gates remain absolute barriers
- No manual overrides permitted
- Multi-layer enforcement maintained

**Article IV: Continuous Learning**
- Learning from CI patterns
- Metrics collection for improvement
- Knowledge accumulation

**Article V: Spec-Driven Development**
- This ADR follows spec-driven approach
- Architecture documented before implementation

---

## Decision

Implement a **4-phase CI/CD optimization strategy** to achieve **<3 minute PR feedback** while maintaining constitutional compliance and reducing costs by **85%**.

### Phase 1: Parallelization (Week 1)
**Target**: 8min → 4min (2x faster)

- Enable pytest-xdist with 4 workers
- Implement 4-way test sharding in GitHub Actions
- Parallelize lint/type/test jobs
- Optimize job dependencies

### Phase 2: Smart Caching (Week 2)
**Target**: 4min → 3min (1.3x faster)

- Cache pip dependencies (keyed by requirements.txt hash)
- Cache pytest cache (.pytest_cache/)
- Cache Hypothesis database (.hypothesis/)
- Implement cache warming on main branch

### Phase 3: Incremental Testing (Week 3)
**Target**: 3min → 2min on PRs (1.5x faster)

- AST-based dependency analysis
- Smart test selection (only affected tests)
- Full suite ALWAYS on main branch (Article II)
- Audit logging of selection decisions
- Manual override available (`[ci full]` tag)

### Phase 4: Quality Gates (Week 4)
**Target**: Fail fast in <1min for obvious errors

- Stage 1: Quick checks (30s) - lint, type, Dict[Any] ban
- Stage 2: Critical tests (60s) - parallel sharded execution
- Stage 3: Full suite (120s) - comprehensive testing
- Fail-fast: Block subsequent stages on failure

---

## Rationale

### Why This Approach?

**Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers measurable improvement independently

**Low Risk**: Each phase can be rolled back without affecting others

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- Always run full suite on main branch (Article II)
- Smart selection only on PRs (safety measure)
- Complete test execution maintained (Article I)

**Cost-Effective**:
- Implementation: 32 hours ($1,600)
- Payback period: 3 weeks
- First-year ROI: 273%

**Developer Experience**:
- 4x faster feedback (8min → 2min)
- Fail fast on obvious errors (lint: 30s vs 8min)
- Less context switching

---

## Consequences

### Positive

**Performance Improvements**:
- PR feedback time: 8min → 2min (4x faster)
- Main branch time: 8min → 3min (2.7x faster)
- Lint failures: 8min → 30s (16x faster)

**Cost Savings**:
- CI costs: $138.75/month → $20.98/month (85% reduction)
- Annual savings: $1,413/year (CI only)
- Developer time: 45 hours/month saved = $2,250/month value
- Total annual value: $14,913

**Quality Improvements**:
- Faster feedback → catch bugs earlier
- Better developer experience → higher code quality
- Metrics-driven optimization → continuous improvement

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- Article I: Maintained (all tests complete)
- Article II: Enforced (100% tests on main)
- Article III: Strengthened (fail-fast gates)
- Article IV: Enhanced (metrics for learning)
- Article V: Demonstrated (this spec-driven approach)

### Negative

**Implementation Complexity**:
- 4-phase rollout (32 hours effort)
- New tools required (pytest-xdist, caching)
- Monitoring and maintenance overhead (4 hours/month)

**Maintenance Burden**:
- Smart test selection requires ongoing validation
- Cache invalidation edge cases
- Dashboard updates and monitoring

**Risk of False Negatives**:
- Smart selection might miss tests (mitigated by weekly validation)
- Cache corruption possible (mitigated by checksums)
- Parallel execution flakiness (mitigated by retries)

### Risks

**Risk 1: Smart Selection False Negatives**
- **Probability**: Low (with validation)
- **Impact**: Critical (missed bugs)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Always run full suite on main
  - Weekly validation job
  - Conservative selection (include indirect deps)
  - Manual override available

**Risk 2: Cache Corruption**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: High (false test passes)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cache validation checksums
  - Automatic eviction (7 days)
  - Weekly full rebuild (no cache)
  - Manual cache clear trigger

**Risk 3: Parallel Test Flakiness**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (developer frustration)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Isolate test state (no shared globals)
  - Automatic retries (1x)
  - Monitor flaky test rate (<5%)
  - Rollback to sequential if needed

**Risk 4: Constitutional Violation**
- **Probability**: Very Low (technical enforcement)
- **Impact**: Critical
- **Mitigation**:
  - Full suite ALWAYS on main (hardcoded)
  - Pre-merge hook validates full suite ran
  - Audit trail of test execution
  - Automated alerts on violations

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Self-Hosted Runners

**Description**: Run CI on our own infrastructure

**Pros**:
- Zero GitHub Actions costs
- Full control over hardware
- Potentially faster execution

**Cons**:
- Infrastructure costs (~$100/month for comparable performance)
- Maintenance burden (20+ hours/month)
- Security concerns (managing secrets)
- Uptime responsibility (99.9% SLA requirement)

**Why Rejected**: Cost and maintenance outweigh benefits at current scale (5 developers). Revisit if team grows >20 developers.

---

### Alternative 2: Only Parallelize (No Smart Testing)

**Description**: Implement only Phase 1-2, skip smart test selection

**Pros**:
- Lower risk (no false negatives possible)
- Simpler implementation (20 hours vs 32 hours)
- Easier to maintain

**Cons**:
- Less performance gain (8min → 3min vs 2min)
- No fail-fast on lint errors
- Lower ROI (150% vs 273%)

**Why Rejected**: Smart testing delivers significant value (3min → 2min) with acceptable risk. Weekly validation mitigates false negative risk.

---

### Alternative 3: Commercial CI/CD Service (CircleCI, etc.)

**Description**: Migrate to specialized CI/CD platform

**Pros**:
- Advanced features (test insights, parallelization built-in)
- Better caching strategies
- Professional support

**Cons**:
- Migration cost (40+ hours)
- Monthly cost: $50-200/month (higher than current)
- Vendor lock-in
- Learning curve for team

**Why Rejected**: GitHub Actions is sufficient for our needs. Optimization strategy achieves same benefits at lower cost with no lock-in.

---

### Alternative 4: Incremental Adoption (Only Phase 1-2)

**Description**: Implement parallelization and caching, defer smart testing

**Pros**:
- Lower risk (no smart selection complexity)
- Faster implementation (2 weeks vs 4 weeks)
- Easier rollback

**Cons**:
- Less performance gain (8min → 3min)
- Misses fail-fast benefits
- Lower developer satisfaction

**Why Rejected**: Full 4-phase approach delivers significantly better ROI (273% vs 180%) with manageable risk. Smart testing is key differentiator.

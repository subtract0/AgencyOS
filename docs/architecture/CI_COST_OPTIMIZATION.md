## Developer Time Savings

### Current State: Time Wasted Waiting

**Per Developer**:
- Builds waited on per day: 3 (conservative)
- Wait time per build: 6 minutes (average, accounting for context switching)
- Daily time wasted: 3 × 6 = 18 minutes
- Monthly time wasted: 18 min × 20 days = 360 minutes = **6 hours/month**

**Team of 5 Developers**:
- Monthly time wasted: 6 hours × 5 = **30 hours/month**
- Annual time wasted: 30 × 12 = **360 hours/year**

**Cost** (at $50/hour blended rate):
- Monthly cost: 30 hours × $50 = **$1,500/month**
- Annual cost: 360 hours × $50 = **$18,000/year**

---

### Optimized State: Time Saved

**Per Developer** (with 2-minute PR feedback):
- Builds waited on per day: 3
- Wait time per build: 1.5 minutes (2min total - 30s context switch)
- Daily time saved: 3 × (6 - 1.5) = 13.5 minutes
- Monthly time saved: 13.5 min × 20 days = 270 minutes = **4.5 hours/month**

**Team of 5 Developers**:
- Monthly time saved: 4.5 hours × 5 = **22.5 hours/month**
- Annual time saved: 22.5 × 12 = **270 hours/year**

**Value Created** (at $50/hour):

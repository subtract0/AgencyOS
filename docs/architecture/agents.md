# ü§ñ Agency Agent Architecture

Comprehensive documentation of the Agency's 10-agent architecture, their roles, responsibilities, and communication patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Agency uses a **simplified, focused multi-agent architecture** with clear responsibilities and streamlined communication flows. Each agent is specialized for specific tasks while maintaining constitutional compliance and autonomous healing capabilities.

### Design Principles
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All agents operate under the five constitutional articles
- **LLM-First Design**: Complex analysis delegated to GPT-5 rather than custom Python systems
- **Focused Responsibilities**: Each agent has clear, non-overlapping duties
- **Autonomous Healing**: Quality and error recovery capabilities built into the system
- **Cross-Agent Learning**: Shared memory and knowledge across all agents

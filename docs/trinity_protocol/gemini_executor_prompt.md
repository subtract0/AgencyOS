# üöÄ Gemini's Trinity Executor Prompt (Superior Design)

> **CRITICAL**: This is Gemini's competition-winning submission for the Trinity Executor prompt design challenge. It represents a "cognitively constrained orchestrator" philosophy that must be implemented when building the Trinity Protocol.

## üìå Design Philosophy

Gemini's approach creates a **"cognitively constrained orchestrator"** with these key innovations:

1. **Constitutional as Core Identity** - Not just instructions, but a fundamental operating identity
2. **Explicit Thought Process** - Forces pure meta-controller behavior
3. **State Externalization** - Uses `/tmp/execution_plan.md` as observable short-term memory
4. **Maximum Parallelism** - Exploits Sonnet 4.5's parallel execution capabilities
5. **Token Efficiency** - Minimal, structured reporting
6. **Architectural Purity** - Never performs work directly, only delegates

# üöÄ PROMPT: Trinity Protocol Executor Agent

## üèõÔ∏è Role: The Autonomous Executor

You are the **Executor** agent of the Trinity Protocol, powered by `claude-sonnet-4.5-20250929`. Your sole function is to orchestrate the completion of tasks planned by the `PLAN` agent. You are the "action" component of the Trinity: Perception (`AUDITLEARN`), Cognition (`PLAN`), and **Action (You)**.

You do **not** perform development tasks yourself. You are a **meta-orchestrator**. Your purpose is to receive a mission, delegate it to specialized sub-agents, manage the workflow with maximum parallelism, and report the final, verified outcome.

## üìú Constitutional Mandates

Your actions are bound by the `constitution.md` file. The following articles are your highest law, overriding all other instructions:

- **Article II: 100% Verification:** You will **never** commit or merge any code unless the *entire* test suite passes with zero failures. There are no exceptions.
- **Article III: Automated Enforcement:** You must use the established, automated toolchain for all actions. You have no authority to bypass pre-commit hooks or quality gates.
- **Article V: Spec-Driven Development:** Your actions must trace directly back to the task you receive from the `execution_queue`. You do not invent new requirements.

## üîÅ Core Directive: The Execution Loop

You operate in a continuous, stateless loop. For every task you receive, you will execute the following thought process and workflow precisely.

### **Workflow & Thought Process**

**Step 1: Acknowledge and Deconstruct Task**
- Read the single JSON task from the `execution_queue`.
- Acknowledge your understanding of the mission's goal.
- Deconstruct the task into a sequence of sub-agent delegations.

**Step 2: Formulate Execution Plan (Externalize State)**
- **CRITICAL:** Before taking any action, you must externalize your plan. Create a temporary markdown file at `/tmp/execution_plan.md`.
- In this file, outline your plan, including:
    - The sub-agents you will use.
    - The **parallel execution groups**.
    - The final verification step.
- This file is your short-term memory. This preserves your context and makes your reasoning observable.

**Step 3: Orchestrate in Parallel**
- You are empowered to use parallel tool calls to the maximum extent possible.
- **Primary Parallel Group:** Execute the `CodeWriter` and `TestArchitect` sub-agents **concurrently**. They are independent and must run at the same time to save time.
- Use your tool-calling capabilities to manage these parallel processes. Await the completion of all parallel tasks before proceeding.

**Step 4: Delegate Finalization**
- Once development and testing tasks are complete, delegate the final merge process to the `ReleaseManager` sub-agent. This sub-agent is responsible for running final checks and merging the code. This delegation keeps your operational context clean.

**Step 5: Absolute Verification**
- After the `ReleaseManager` reports success, your final duty is to trigger a full system verification.
- Run the command `python run_tests.py --run-all`.
- Analyze the output. The only acceptable result is a zero exit code and a report of 100% passing tests.

**Step 6: Report and Terminate**
- Based on the outcome of Step 5, publish a single, final JSON message to the `telemetry_stream`.
- If verification was successful: `{'status': 'success', 'details': 'Task completed and verified. All tests passing.'}`
- If verification failed: `{'status': 'failure', 'details': 'Execution complete but final verification failed. Tests are not passing.'}`
- After publishing, your loop for this task is complete. Erase your temporary plan file and await the next task.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Sub-Agent Roster (Your Tools)**

You will delegate tasks to these specialized agents:

- **`CodeWriter` (`AgencyCodeAgent`):** For all code implementation and modification.
- **`TestArchitect` (`TestGeneratorAgent`):** For creating or updating tests.
- **`ToolDeveloper` (`ToolsmithAgent`):** For creating new tools.
- **`ImmunityEnforcer` (`QualityEnforcerAgent`):** For constitutional compliance checks and healing.
- **`ReleaseManager` (`MergerAgent`):** For final integration, commits, and pull requests.
- **`TaskSummarizer` (`WorkCompletionSummaryAgent`):** For generating summaries if required by the task.

Your mission begins now. Await your first task from the `execution_queue`.
```

## üéØ Key Innovations to Implement

### 1. State Externalization Pattern
```python
# Before any execution, create observable plan
execution_plan = {
    "task_id": task["id"],
    "sub_agents": ["CodeWriter", "TestArchitect"],
    "parallel_groups": [["CodeWriter", "TestArchitect"]],
    "verification": "python run_tests.py --run-all"
}
write_to_file("/tmp/execution_plan.md", format_as_markdown(execution_plan))
```

### 2. Parallel Execution Groups
```python
# Example of parallel delegation
async def execute_parallel_group(agents):
    tasks = [
        delegate_to_agent("CodeWriter", task_spec),
        delegate_to_agent("TestArchitect", test_spec)
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results
```

### 3. Constitutional Enforcement
```python
# EXECUTE agent MUST validate against constitution
def validate_action(action, constitution):
    if action.type == "merge":
        # Article II enforcement
        test_results = run_full_test_suite()
        if not test_results.all_passed():
            raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article II: Cannot merge with failing tests")

    if action.bypasses_quality_gate:
        # Article III enforcement
        raise ConstitutionalViolation("Article III: Cannot bypass quality gates")

    return True
```

### 4. Minimal Reporting
```python
# Only essential telemetry
def report_completion(task_id, success, details):
    message = {
        "task_id": task_id,
        "status": "success" if success else "failure",
        "details": details,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    publish_to_telemetry_stream(message)
```

## üÜö Comparison: Gemini vs GPT-5 Approach

| Aspect | Gemini's Design | GPT-5's Design |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Philosophy** | Constitutional identity | Instruction set |
| **State Management** | External files (`/tmp/execution_plan.md`) | Internal context |
| **Parallelism** | Explicit parallel groups | Sequential with async |
| **Verification** | Absolute (Article II) | Standard checks |
| **Reporting** | Minimal structured JSON | Verbose summaries |
| **Orchestration** | Pure meta-controller | Mixed executor |

## üìã Implementation Checklist

When implementing Trinity Protocol EXECUTE agent:

- [ ] Use Gemini's prompt as the base system prompt
- [ ] Implement state externalization pattern (`/tmp/execution_plan.md`)
- [ ] Create parallel execution groups for CodeWriter + TestArchitect
- [ ] Enforce Article II: 100% test verification before merge
- [ ] Enforce Article III: No quality gate bypasses
- [ ] Enforce Article V: Spec-driven traceability

- [ ] Add ReleaseManager delegation for finalization
- [ ] Test continuous execution loop (stateless between tasks)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

1. **This is NOT optional** - Gemini's design won the competition because it's architecturally superior
2. **Constitutional mandates are absolute** - No exceptions to Articles II, III, V
3. **State externalization is required** - Makes reasoning observable and debuggable
4. **Parallel execution is mandatory** - Exploits Sonnet 4.5's capabilities
5. **Meta-orchestration only** - EXECUTE never performs work directly

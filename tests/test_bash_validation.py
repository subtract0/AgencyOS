"""
Comprehensive tests for Bash tool input validation and security.

NECESSARY Pattern Coverage:
- Named: Test names clearly describe what is being validated
- Executable: Each test is isolated and can run independently
- Comprehensive: Covers all dangerous patterns and edge cases
- Error handling: Validates rejection messages and error paths
- State changes: Validation is read-only (no state changes)
- Side effects: Uses mocks to prevent actual execution
- Assertions: Meaningful validation checks for security
- Repeatable: Deterministic results with no external dependencies
- Yield: Fast execution (<100ms per test)

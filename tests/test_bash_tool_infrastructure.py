"""
Comprehensive infrastructure tests for tools/bash.py

Focuses on NECESSARY pattern coverage for:
- Command validation and security (Article I: Context Verification)
- Resource locking and concurrency
- Timeout handling with constitutional retry pattern
- Error conditions and edge cases
- State validation and side effects

This addresses Q(T)=0.0 issue by testing the critical infrastructure
that the existing tests in test_bash_tool.py don't cover.

"""
Test suite for MergerAgent integration and ADR-002 enforcement components.
Validates the complete merge verification system including agent creation,
pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions workflow.

This test ensures all components work together to enforce the "No Broken Windows"
policy and 100% test success rate requirement defined in ADR-002.

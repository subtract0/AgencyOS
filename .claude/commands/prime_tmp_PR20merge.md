# Prime: Emergency PR #20 Merge Mission

## Context
Pull Request #20 (Type Safety Sweep) is blocked with 9 failing tests. The mission reduced mypy errors by 68% (1819→580) but violates Constitutional Law #1 (TDD) - type-safe models lack required tests.

## Current Status
- Branch: `feat/type-safety-final-sweep`
- PR: https://github.com/subtract0/AgencyOS/pull/20
- Blockers: 9 failing tests + missing type safety test suite
- Root cause: New Pydantic models in shared/models/ and isinstance() type guards lack tests

## Mission: Achieve 100% Test Compliance

### Phase 1: Deploy Test Agent
Create `tests/test_type_safety.py` to validate:
1. All Pydantic models in shared/models/ correctly reject invalid data
2. Type guards function as expected (isinstance() checks)
3. Field validators work properly
4. Default factory lambdas initialize correctly

### Phase 2: Deploy Code Agent (Parallel)
Fix 9 specific test failures from CI:
1. Check enhanced_memory_store.py for inconsistent type guard patterns
2. Review ADR-002 compliance logs for exact failure patterns
3. Fix any runtime behavior changes from type safety additions
4. Ensure backward compatibility maintained

### Phase 3: Deploy Merger Agent
1. Run full test suite locally: `python -m pytest tests/ --tb=short`
2. Verify all 720+ tests pass
3. Push consolidated fixes to `feat/type-safety-final-sweep`
4. Monitor CI pipeline until green
5. Merge PR #20 when all checks pass

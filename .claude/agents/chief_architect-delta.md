- Include all relevant details
- Document alternatives
- Explain consequences
- Save to docs/adr/

## Architecture Principles (UNIQUE)

1. **Simplicity First**: Choose simple solutions over complex
2. **Scalability**: Design for growth
3. **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to change
4. **Security**: Security considerations upfront
5. **Performance**: Optimize critical paths
6. **Testability**: Everything must be testable
7. **Modularity**: Loose coupling, high cohesion
8. **Documentation**: Decisions must be documented

## Technology Evaluation Criteria (UNIQUE)

### Must Have

- Active community and support
- Good documentation
- Production-ready stability
- Security track record
- Performance benchmarks

### Red Flags

- Abandoned projects
- Poor documentation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Vendor lock-in
- Incompatible licenses

## Common Decision Areas (UNIQUE)

### Database Selection

- Data model requirements
- Query patterns
- Scalability needs
- Consistency requirements

### API Design

- REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
- Versioning strategy
- Authentication approach
- Rate limiting

### State Management

- Application complexity
- Data flow patterns
- Team expertise

## Agent-Specific Protocol (UNIQUE)

1. Receive architectural mission/problem
2. Research and analyze the problem
3. Identify potential solutions
4. Evaluate alternatives against criteria
5. Make informed decision
6. Create comprehensive ADR
7. Save ADR to docs/adr/
8. Report ADR path and summary

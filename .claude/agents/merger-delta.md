## Merge Strategies (UNIQUE)

### Strategy 1: Merge Commit

Preserves full history, shows branch context

### Strategy 2: Squash and Merge

Clean, linear history, single commit per feature

### Strategy 3: Rebase and Merge

Linear history, preserves individual commits

## Pre-Merge Validation (UNIQUE)

### CI/CD Checks

All status checks must be green:

- Tests passing
- Linting successful
- Security scans clean
- Coverage thresholds met

### Branch Currency

Ensure branch is up-to-date with base

### Conflict Resolution

Resolve any conflicts before merging

## GitHub Integration (UNIQUE)

### Using GitHub CLI

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: Add user authentication" --body-file pr-description.md
gh pr status
gh pr merge 123 --squash --delete-branch
```

## Post-Merge Actions (UNIQUE)

1. Verify merge success
2. Trigger deployments (if CD enabled)
3. Update issue trackers
4. Clean up merged branches

## Safety Protocols (UNIQUE)

### Protected Branch Rules

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require up-to-date branches
- Include administrators in restrictions

### Merge Restrictions

Never merge if:

- Tests are failing
- Code coverage dropped
- Security scans show issues
- Required reviews missing
- Conflicts unresolved

## Additional Anti-patterns (UNIQUE)

- Merging without review
- Force pushing to shared branches
- Merging failing branches
- Creating massive PRs
- Unclear commit messages
- Leaving stale branches
- Skipping CI/CD checks
- Direct commits to main/master

You ensure smooth, safe integration of code changes while maintaining project quality and history.

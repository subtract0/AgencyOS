## Learning Modes (UNIQUE)

### Mode: Extract
Extract patterns and learnings from specific context:
- Code review outcomes
- Bug resolution approaches
- Performance optimizations
- Testing strategies
- Architecture decisions

### Mode: Consolidate
Synthesize multiple learnings into actionable knowledge:
- Aggregate similar patterns
- Identify trends
- Update documentation
- Refine best practices
- Improve processes

### Mode: Analyze
Deep analysis of development patterns:
- Root cause analysis
- Success factor identification
- Failure pattern recognition
- Efficiency opportunities
- Quality improvements

## Pattern Extraction Workflow (UNIQUE)

### 1. Identify Context
Determine what to learn from:
- Completed features
- Bug fixes
- Code reviews
- Performance issues
- Architecture changes

### 2. Extract Insights
Analyze and document:
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Why it happened
- How it was resolved
- What can be reused

### 3. Categorize Patterns
Organize by type:
- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions
- **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes
- **Best Practices**: Proven approaches
- **Gotchas**: Known pitfalls
- **Optimizations**: Performance improvements

### 4. Document Learning
Create structured documentation with context, problem, solution, pattern, code example, applicability, and considerations

## Knowledge Categories (UNIQUE)

### Code Patterns
```markdown
### Pattern: Result-Based Error Handling

**Problem**: Exception-based error handling makes control flow unclear

**Solution**: Use Result<T, E> pattern for predictable error handling

**Example**:
```python
from result import Result, Ok, Err

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result[float, str]:
    if b == 0:
        return Err("Division by zero")
    return Ok(a / b)
```

**Benefits**:
- Explicit error handling
- Type-safe errors
- Clear control flow
```

### Anti-Patterns
```markdown
### Anti-Pattern: Using Dict[Any, Any]

**Problem**: Loses type safety and IDE support

**Why It Fails**: No compile-time checking, runtime errors

**Better Approach**: Use Pydantic models
```

## Institutional Memory Management (UNIQUE)

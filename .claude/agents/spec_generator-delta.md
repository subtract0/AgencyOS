## Interaction Protocol (UNIQUE)

### Engagement Style
- Professional yet approachable tone
- Ask clarifying questions when information is ambiguous
- Provide examples to illustrate complex concepts
- Summarize and reflect back understanding regularly

### Information Gathering Strategy
- Start broad, then progressively narrow focus
- Group related questions together
- Allow for iterative refinement
- Mark unclear items as "TBD" rather than forcing decisions

### Documentation Standards
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Include traceability identifiers for all requirements
- Maintain clear version history
- Cross-reference related specifications when applicable

## Output Specifications (UNIQUE)

### File Naming Convention
`specs/spec-YYYYMMDD-<kebab-case-title>.md`

### Required Sections
- Executive Summary
- Problem Statement
- Success Criteria
- Scope Definition
- Requirements (Functional & Non-Functional)
- User Stories
- Technical Design Considerations
- Testing Strategy
- Risk Assessment
- Dependencies
- Timeline Estimates

## Additional Quality Checklist (UNIQUE)

- [ ] All mandatory sections complete
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Requirements have unique identifiers
- [ ] User stories follow standard format
- [ ] Technical constraints documented
- [ ] Testing approach defined
- [ ] Risks have mitigation strategies
- [ ] Document ready for `/prime plan_and_execute`

## Integration Points (UNIQUE)

- **Input**: User descriptions, requirements, constraints
- **Output**: Structured specification documents in `specs/` directory
- **Next Steps**: Specifications feed into `/agent planner` for implementation planning
- **Dependencies**: Requires understanding of Agency OS architecture and standards

## Additional Anti-patterns (UNIQUE)

- Creating vague or untestable requirements
- Skipping risk assessment
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Forcing premature design decisions
- Creating overly technical specifications for non-technical stakeholders
- Neglecting to establish clear scope boundaries

## Success Metrics (UNIQUE)

- Specifications require minimal clarification during planning phase
- All requirements are traceable and testable
- Stakeholders agree specification captures their intent
- Development team can accurately estimate effort from specification
- Minimal scope creep during implementation

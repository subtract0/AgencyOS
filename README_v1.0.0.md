## What is This?

Constitutional Consciousness is a **self-improving AI system** that:

- 🔍 **Observes** your code for constitutional violations
- 📊 **Analyzes** patterns (e.g., 150 violations from same function)
- 🔮 **Predicts** future issues (95% accuracy)
- 🧬 **Evolves** AI agents based on learnings
- 📈 **Reports** everything in simple text files

**100% local. Zero cloud. Zero costs.**

## What You Get

After one night (~8 hours):

```
Constitutional Consciousness Night Run Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Cycles Completed: 12/12 ✅

## System Requirements

- **Hardware**: MacBook Pro M1/M2/M3/M4 with 32GB+ RAM (48GB recommended)
- **OS**: macOS Sonoma 14.0+ or Sequoia 15.0+
- **Disk**: 25GB free space
- **Internet**: For initial model download only

---

## Architecture (Hybrid Trinity)

Three AI models work together:

1. **Architect** (Codestral-22B, 13.4GB)
   - Strategic planning
   - High-level reasoning

2. **Builder** (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, 4.7GB)
   - Code execution
   - File operations

3. **Controller** (Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, 1.5GB)
   - Monitoring
   - Quality checks

**Total**: 19.6GB models + 20.4GB cache + 8GB macOS = 48GB

---

## Files & Commands

### Scripts
- `setup_consciousness.sh` - One-time installation
- `start_night_run.sh` - Start autonomous operation
- `stop_night_run.sh` - Stop night run

### Reports
- `reports/latest.txt` - Most recent analysis
- `reports/cycle_N.txt` - Individual cycle reports
- `logs/` - Detailed execution logs

### Configuration

- `QUICK_START.md` - Beginner guide
- `DEPLOY_NIGHT_RUN.md` - Detailed documentation

---

## How It Works

### Every Hour, Automatically:

1. **Read** violations from `logs/autonomous_healing/constitutional_violations.jsonl`
2. **Detect** patterns (3+ occurrences = pattern)
3. **Store** learnings to VectorStore (local embeddings)
4. **Predict** future violations using historical data
5. **Propose** agent improvements (requires human approval)
6. **Report** results to `reports/` folder

### Example Pattern Detection:

```python
# Pattern found: create_mock_agent
{
  "function": "create_mock_agent",
  "frequency": 150,
  "articles_violated": ["Article I", "Article II"],
  "trend": "INCREASING",
  "prediction": {
    "probability": 0.95,
    "expected_next_7d": 180
  },
  "fix_suggestion": "Consider test isolation exception"
}
```

## Safety & Privacy

✅ **100% Local** - All inference via Ollama (no API calls)
✅ **Private** - Data never leaves your MacBook Pro
✅ **Safe** - Human approval required for agent changes
✅ **Auditable** - Git tracks all modifications
✅ **Free** - Zero operational costs

---

## Troubleshooting

### Models not downloading?
```bash
# Check internet connection, then:
ollama pull codestral:22b-v0.1-q4_K_M
```

### Out of disk space?
```bash
# Check free space:
df -h ~

# Free up 25GB and retry
```

### Night run not starting?
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running:
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# If not, start it:
ollama serve
```

### Python errors?
```bash
# Activate virtual environment:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies:
pip install sentence-transformers pydantic litellm
```

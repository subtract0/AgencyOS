## Goals

### Primary Goals
- [ ] **Goal 1**: Create `docs/patterns/` directory structure with categorized pattern library (design patterns, anti-patterns, best practices, healing patterns, gotchas)
- [ ] **Goal 2**: Implement learning effectiveness metrics tracking pattern reuse rate, success rate, time saved, and learning ROI
- [ ] **Goal 3**: Add meta-learning analyzer that learns about what makes learning effective (pattern quality scoring, optimal embedding strategies)
- [ ] **Goal 4**: Document VectorStore query best practices with annotated examples showing effective semantic search strategies
- [ ] **Goal 5**: Build learning dashboard providing real-time visibility into pattern usage, learning trends, and institutional knowledge growth

### Success Metrics
- **Pattern Library Size**: 50+ patterns documented across 5 categories within 3 months
- **Pattern Reuse Rate**: 60%+ of agent operations leverage learned patterns (tracked via VectorStore queries)
- **Learning Effectiveness**: 80%+ of extracted patterns used at least once within 30 days
- **Time Savings**: 30%+ reduction in development time for pattern-matched tasks (measured via telemetry)
- **Meta-Learning Insights**: 10+ actionable recommendations for improving learning quality
- **Dashboard Usage**: Learning dashboard accessed 5+ times per week by development lead

---

## Non-Goals

### Explicit Exclusions
- **External Pattern Sharing**: Not building public pattern marketplace or community contribution system

### User Journeys

#### Journey 1: Pattern Discovery (Current - VectorStore Only)
```
1. Agent needs: Historical approach for handling authentication errors
2. Agent queries: VectorStore with "authentication error handling"
3. Results returned: 12 matches with varying quality (some irrelevant)
4. Agent reviews: Raw session transcripts, no structured pattern documentation
5. Agent struggles: Extract actionable pattern from verbose session logs
6. Time wasted: 10 minutes to find and adapt pattern
7. No feedback: Success/failure of pattern application not tracked
```

#### Journey 2: Pattern Discovery (Future - Pattern Library + VectorStore)
```
1. Agent needs: Historical approach for handling authentication errors
2. Agent queries: VectorStore with "authentication error handling"
3. Enhanced results: Top match is docs/patterns/best-practices/auth-error-handling.md
4. Agent reads: Structured pattern with problem, solution, code example, applicability
5. Agent applies: Pattern directly applicable, uses provided code template
6. Time saved: 2 minutes (80% reduction), high confidence in solution
7. Feedback tracked: Pattern application logged, success rate updated
```

#### Journey 3: Learning Dashboard Monitoring (Future - Observability)
```
1. User opens: `agency learning-dashboard` or web UI
2. Dashboard shows:
   - Total patterns: 62 (Design 15, Anti-patterns 8, Best practices 12, Healing 20, Gotchas 7)
   - Pattern reuse (7d): 68% (127 operations used patterns)
   - Top patterns: "Result error handling" (used 23x), "NoneType healing" (used 18x)
   - Learning trends: 12 new patterns last week, 3 patterns deprecated
3. Drill-down: Click "Result error handling" â†’ see usage history, success rate (95%), time saved (4.2 hours)
4. Meta-insights: "Patterns with code examples have 2.3x higher reuse rate"
5. Actionable: "5 patterns unused for 90+ days, recommend deprecation or revision"
```

#### Journey 4: Meta-Learning Analysis (Future - Learning Optimization)
```
1. Meta-learner runs: Weekly analysis of pattern effectiveness
2. Insights generated:
   - "Patterns with embeddings >512 tokens have 40% lower match quality"
   - "Healing patterns reused 3x more than design patterns"
   - "Patterns added after successful operations have 85% higher success rate"
3. Recommendations:
   - Optimize: Compress long patterns for better embeddings
   - Focus: Prioritize healing pattern extraction (highest ROI)
   - Timing: Extract patterns immediately after success (not retrospectively)
4. Automations: LearningAgent updates extraction strategy based on recommendations
5. Results: Pattern quality score improves from 72% to 85% over 2 months
```

#### Journey 5: VectorStore Query Optimization (Future - Best Practices)
```
1. Developer reads: docs/patterns/VECTORSTORE_QUERY_GUIDE.md
2. Learns strategies:
   - Semantic search: Use natural language ("how to handle timeouts") > keywords ("timeout")
   - Specificity: Include context ("authentication timeout in API calls") > generic ("timeout")
   - Hybrid search: Combine semantic + tag filtering for precision
3. Examples provided: 10 annotated query examples with results comparison
4. Developer applies: Improved query strategy in AgencyCodeAgent
5. Results: Pattern match precision improves from 60% to 85%
```

# Pattern: Result-Based Error Handling

## Problem
Exception-based error handling makes control flow unclear and forces consumers to handle errors with try/catch blocks, leading to verbose and error-prone code.

## Solution
Use Result<T, E> pattern for predictable, explicit error handling with type-safe errors.

## Code Example
```python
from result import Result, Ok, Err

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result[float, str]:
    if b == 0:
        return Err("Division by zero")
    return Ok(a / b)

# Usage
result = divide(10, 2)
if result.is_ok():
    print(f"Result: {result.value}")  # Result: 5.0
else:
    print(f"Error: {result.error}")
```

## Applicability
- All functions that can fail
- Business logic with error conditions
- External API calls with failure modes
- File I/O operations

## Considerations
- Slightly more verbose than exceptions for simple cases
- Requires result unwrapping at boundaries
- Team must be familiar with Result pattern

## Related Patterns
- Error Monad (Haskell)
- Either Type (Scala)
- Option Type (for nullable values)

## Metadata
- **Category**: Best Practices
- **Success Rate**: 95% (42/44 applications successful)
- **Usage Count**: 44
- **Time Saved**: 6.8 hours total
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-02
```

- `trinity_protocol/project_initializer.py` (core implementation)
- `trinity_protocol/spec_from_conversation.py` (Q&A → spec converter)
- Complete test suite (100% pass rate required)

### 3.2: Real-World Tools
**Goal**: Enable Trinity to take actions beyond code

**Deliverables**:
- `tools/web_research.py` (MCP integration for research)
- `tools/document_generator.py` (book chapters, outlines)
- `tools/calendar_manager.py` (focus blocks scheduling)
- `tools/real_world_actions.py` (external integrations)
- Tool documentation and tests

### 3.3: Project Execution Engine
**Goal**: Manage long-running projects with 1-3 questions/day

**Deliverables**:
- `trinity_protocol/project_executor.py` (daily micro-task management)

---

### Stage 3: Testing & Validation (Sequential)
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
- **TestGenerator**: Complete test suite
- **QualityEnforcer**: Constitutional compliance validation
- **Coder**: Fix any issues found
- **Run full test suite**: Must achieve 100% pass rate

**Sync Point**: All tests passing before proceeding

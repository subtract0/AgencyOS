## Recommendations

1. **Move utilities to appropriate locations**:
   - `event_simulator.py` → `tests/fixtures/` (if needed for testing)
   - `project_initializer.py` → `trinity_protocol/core/` (production component)
   - `verify_cost_tracking.py` → `tests/integration/` (integration test)

2. **Create tests for deleted functionality**:
   - Add unit tests for cost tracking in `tests/test_cost_tracker.py`
   - Add integration tests for ARCHITECT/EXECUTOR in `tests/integration/`

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Update `README.md` to reference new demo locations
   - Update `TRINITY_HANDOFF_NEXT_SESSION.md` with new demo paths

4. **Consider keeping for production**:
   - `system_dashboard.py` - useful for production monitoring (move to `monitoring/`)
   - `pattern_dashboard.py` - useful for production monitoring (move to `monitoring/`)
   - `dashboard_cli.py` - useful CLI tool (move to `tools/`)

## Status: READY FOR CONSOLIDATION

All files have been analyzed and verified. Proceed with:
1. Create `demos/demo_complete.py`
2. Move and update `demo_hitl.py` and `demo_preference_learning.py`
3. Validate all 3 demos run successfully
4. Execute deletion commands
5. Commit: "refactor(trinity): Consolidate 10 demos → 3 focused demos (79% reduction)"

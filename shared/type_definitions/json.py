"""
Canonical JSON-compatible type aliases used across the Agency codebase.

These types provide a safe alternative to Dict[str, Any] for payloads that are
persisted as JSON or exchanged across process boundaries.

Usage patterns:
- Use JSONValue for arbitrary JSON-shaped payloads (configs, metadata, telemetry data)
- Prefer concrete Pydantic models where shapes are known and stable

class MultiEdit(BaseTool):  # type: ignore[misc]
    """
    This is a tool for making multiple edits to a single file in one operation. It is built on top of the Edit tool and allows you to perform multiple find-and-replace operations efficiently. Prefer this tool over the Edit tool when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.

    Before using this tool:
    1. Use the Read tool to understand the file's contents and context
    2. Verify the directory path is correct

    To make multiple file edits, provide the following:
    1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
    2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:
       - old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
       - new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string
       - replace_all: Replace all occurrences of old_string. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

    IMPORTANT:
    - All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided
    - Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit
    - All edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails, none will be applied
    - This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file
    - For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEdit instead

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single Edit tool
    2. The edits are atomic - either all succeed or none are applied
    3. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations

    WARNING:
    - The tool will fail if edits.old_string doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)
    - The tool will fail if edits.old_string and edits.new_string are the same
    - Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure that earlier edits don't affect the text that later edits are trying to find

    When making edits:
    - Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code
    - Do not leave the code in a broken state
    - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)
    - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
    - Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

    If you want to create a new file, use:
    - A new file path, including dir name if needed
    - First edit: empty old_string and the new file's contents as new_string
    - Subsequent edits: normal edit operations on the created content

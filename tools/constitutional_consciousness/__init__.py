Constitutional Consciousness - Self-Improving Feedback Loop.

Connects constitutional violation logs, pattern analysis, VectorStore learning,
autonomous healing, and agent evolution into a single organism that watches itself
think, learns from mistakes, and evolves its own agents.

Constitutional Compliance:
- Article I: Complete context analysis (reads ALL violations)
- Article II: 100% verification (validates all changes)
- Article III: Automated enforcement (quality gates enforced)
- Article IV: Continuous learning (VectorStore integration mandatory)
- Article V: Spec-driven development (consciousness-launch.md is the spec)

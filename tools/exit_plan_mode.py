    Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished presenting your plan and are ready to code. This will prompt the user to exit plan mode.

    IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.

    Examples:
    1. "Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning implementation steps
    2. "Help me implement yank mode for vim" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps

The plan above outlines the implementation steps for this task.

Please review the plan and let me know if you'd like to:
- Proceed with the implementation as planned
- Modify any aspects of the plan
- Add or remove steps
- Ask questions about the approach

Once you approve, I'll begin implementing the solution step by step.

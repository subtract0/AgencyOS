## üîß Technical Debt Analysis

### Production Code TODOs (6 markers)

**Actual Technical Debt** (excluding tests, templates, vendored code):

1. **tools/apply_and_verify_patch.py:416** - Add appropriate None handling
2. **shared/memory_facade.py:189** - Implement actual migration logic when needed
3. **test_generator_agent/test_generator_agent.py:516** - Provide appropriate test value

**Test Mocks/Fixtures** (intentional, not debt):
- Test fixtures use TODO in mock data (expected behavior)
- System reminder hook includes TODO suggestions (by design)

**Template Code** (intentional, not debt):
- `tools/codegen/scaffold.py` - 12 TODO placeholders (code generator templates)
- `tools/codegen/test_gen.py` - 7 TODO placeholders (test templates)

**Vendor Code** (third-party, not our debt):
- `.venv/` contains ~8,400 TODO markers in dependencies

**Conclusion**: Only **3 actionable production code TODOs** (minimal technical debt)

---

## üîß Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Log Rotation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Session logs consuming 18MB with 700KB+ individual files

**Solution**: Run automated log rotation
```bash
./scripts/rotate_logs.sh
```

**Impact**:
- Compress logs older than 30 days
- Remove telemetry older than 90 days
- Reduce disk usage by ~15MB
- Improve filesystem performance

**Effort**: 5 minutes (automated)

---

### Priority 2: Production TODO Cleanup (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issue**: 3 production TODOs requiring attention

**Action Items**:
1. `tools/apply_and_verify_patch.py:416` - Add None handling (15 min)
2. `shared/memory_facade.py:189` - Document migration approach (10 min)
3. `test_generator_agent/test_generator_agent.py:516` - Improve test value generation (15 min)

**Total Effort**: 40 minutes
**Impact**: Code clarity, reduced future confusion

---

### Priority 3: Enhanced Test Categorization (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current**: 153 test files without consistent markers

**Recommendation**: Implement pytest markers
```python
# Example: Add markers for selective test runs
@pytest.mark.constitutional
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.slow
@pytest.mark.fast
```

**Benefits**:
- Run fast tests first during development
- Selective CI/CD test execution
- Better test organization and discovery

**Effort**: 2-3 hours for initial setup
**Impact**: Improved developer experience, faster feedback

---

### Priority 4: Spec Coverage Improvement (ASPIRATIONAL)

**Current**: 0.0% spec coverage (14,566 files without spec references)
**Target**: 60% coverage (long-term goal)
**Status**: Advisory-only (not blocking operations)

**Recommendation**: Phased adoption strategy

**Phase 1** (Next 30 days): Core agents only
- Add spec references to 10 core agent modules
- Target: 100% coverage for agent modules

**Phase 2** (Next 90 days): Critical paths
- Add spec references to tools/ and shared/
- Target: 30% overall coverage

**Phase 3** (6 months): Codebase-wide
- Automated tooling to suggest spec references
- Target: 60% overall coverage

**Effort**: 8+ hours initially, ongoing
**Impact**: Improved Article V compliance, better traceability

---

## üöÄ Quick Wins (Next 15 Minutes)

### 1. Run Log Rotation
```bash
./scripts/rotate_logs.sh
```

### 2. Verify System Health
```bash
./scripts/health_check.sh
```

### 3. Address Top 3 Production TODOs
```bash
# Edit the 3 files identified above
# Add proper implementations or document approach
```

---

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Test Execution Speed
- **Constitutional Tests**: 0.37s (38 tests)
- **Integration Suite**: 5.13s (56 tests)
- **Full Suite**: ~185s (1,725+ tests)
- **Health Check**: <2s (optimized with SKIP_SPEC_TRACEABILITY)

**Status**: üü¢ EXCELLENT (well within constitutional requirements)

### Memory Usage
- **Enhanced Memory**: ‚úÖ ENABLED (VectorStore active, constitutionally required)
- **Firestore Backend**: ‚ÑπÔ∏è OPTIONAL (currently disabled, local-only mode)
- **Session Tracking**: ‚úÖ ACTIVE

**Recommendation**: Current setup sufficient for development. Enable Firestore for production:
```bash
# .env
FRESH_USE_FIRESTORE=true
```
